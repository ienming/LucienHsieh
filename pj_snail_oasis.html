Ideally, I want to show the main message that in  the past, love songs which talks about heart-broken will usually show more negative attitudes in  the lyrics. However, in recent years, lyrics with lots of positive/aggressive attitudes have also  appeared even though the story is heart-broken.", "Thus, I made up three hypothesis which I will try to verify on the visualization. First, the  attitudes of lyrics have changed according to different themes of romantic songs during 15 years.  Second, certain usage of “subject” usually appears with certain attitude. Third, certain usage of  “love”(this word) usually comes up with certain subject or attitude, and also, there is a pattern of  usage of “love” in Chinese Popular Romantic Song."]
